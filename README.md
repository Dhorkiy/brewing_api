# microsomething

A microservice project invloving Docker and splitting up an API into seperate GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. 
This will be achieved by a NGINX reverse proxy delegating these requests to the appropriate counter part. 
DB solution will be something like MySQL.

See http://codehandbook.org/python-web-application-flask-mysql/ for using flask with MySQL
